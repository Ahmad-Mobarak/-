Bara Al-Salfa - Social Deduction Game
Bara Al-Salfa (literally "Outside the Story") is an Arabic social party game similar to Mafia or Werewolf, designed for 3+ players. It's a fun guessing and deduction game perfect for groups and gatherings.
How to Play:

Setup: Players choose a category (food, animals, clothing, drinks, car brands, etc.) and one player is secretly assigned as the "outsider" (Bara Al-Salfa)
Secret Cards: All players except the outsider receive the same secret word from the chosen category. The outsider gets a different word or no word at all.
Discussion Rounds: Players take turns sharing information or asking questions about their word without being too obvious. The outsider must try to blend in and figure out what the real word is.
Voting Phase: After several rounds of discussion, everyone votes on who they think is the "outsider"
Scoring:

If the group correctly identifies the outsider: +10 points each
If the outsider correctly guesses the secret word: +10 points to the outsider
If the outsider fools everyone: +10 points to the outsider



Game Features:

Two Play Modes: Information sharing mode or question-asking mode
Multiple Categories: Various themed word lists
Customizable Rounds: Adjustable number of discussion laps
Score Tracking: Keeps track of points across multiple rounds
Arabic Interface: Fully localized for Arabic speakers

This game encourages social interaction, quick thinking, and deductive reasoning while maintaining an element of mystery and fun deception!
